# MCCE

Minecraft: Chaos Edition (MCCE) is a mod which causes the game to apply chaotic effects over time, leading to insanity, chaos, and a unique challenge.

The goal of MCCE is to capture the same chaotic experience as its namesake that inspired it all - Super Mario 64: Chaos Edition, a hack for SM64 which changes the game's code to provide a kind of cursed challenge. While MCCE isn't at all a direct translation from the exact mechanics of its namesake, its goal is to provide a "Minecraft" take on the idea.

MCCE presents itself as a challenge focused mod, where the goal would be to see how far one can make it with the random effects that get applied over time. Self imposed challenges such as acquiring diamonds, netherite, or defeating the Ender Dragon, etc. are what MCCE is all about. MCCE is geared towards insanity for the sake of entertainment, be it from the user or from viewers.

Note that some effects that are applied are applied **silently**. You won't know they've been applied until you see the results! Other effects may have sound based cues. Some effects may prove to be beneficial! It's all about trying to make the best out of a bad situation and preparing for the worst!

MCCE is designed with only the vanilla experience in mind. Some mods may not work well or may not even work at all with MCCE. While compatibility with other mods is certainly an option, it is not one of the primary goals of MCCE.

MCCE is best played blind, though for those curious here's some more details!

   <summary>How MCCE Works</summary>
   MCCE applies one of *forty* different "Chaos Effects" every 750 ticks thereabouts. The interval between effects is random, and sometimes multiple effects can be applied at once. The [wiki](https://github.com/yeelp/MCCE/wiki) goes over each Chaos Effect and mechanics in detail.

  <summary>Why?</summary>
  MCCE came from not only an idea to try to create something that people could enjoy watching others play, but also from a drive to learn Fabric for future modding!
